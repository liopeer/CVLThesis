\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my advisors, Emiljo and Georg, for the support, trust and liberty that I was given over the course of this project. I was able to freely decide the course of this project, and discussions and questions were always received with open arms by the them. Further, I would like to thank Professor Konukoglu for enabling this project in his group and last but not least my friends \& family, who made sure that I would balance work and leisure.
